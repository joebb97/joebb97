### Hi there! 👋 I'm Joey

- ⚡️ I'm software engineer with a passion for **systems software** and **computer security**. 
- 🔒 My day job is working on [Cloudflare Gateway](https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/gateway/)
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn kernel development, firmware, embedded Rust, RISCV, and other niches of systems software.
- 🌱 I'm also attempting to develop skills related to making things! Woodworking + power tools for now, hopefully Welding and CNC down the road.
    - I'm hoping to combine these with my background in Embedded Systems to do some fun [Creative](https://www.youtube.com/c/StuffMadeHere) [Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkRober) projects based on Microcontrollers and FPGAs.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with being an active open source contributor.
- 💬 Talk with me about lifelong learning, the growth mindset, diversity bonuses, and making engineering inclusive to all.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
